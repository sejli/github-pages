### 1. About Me
I'm a fourth year transfer studying ***Computer Science*** at ***UC San Diego***. In my free time, I like to solve Rubik's cubes and play badminton.

### 2. Coursework
- [x] [CSE 100 Advanced Data Sructures](https://catalog.ucsd.edu/courses/CSE.html#cse100) 
  > High-performance data structures and supporting algorithms. Use and implementation of data structures like (un)balanced trees, graphs, priority queues, and hash tables. Also, memory management, pointers, recursion. Theoretical and practical performance analysis, both average case and amortized. Uses C++ and STL.

- [x] [CSE 101. Design and Analysis of Algorithms](https://catalog.ucsd.edu/courses/CSE.html#cse101)
  > Design and analysis of efficient algorithms with emphasis of nonnumerical algorithms such as sorting, searching, pattern matching, and graph and network algorithms. Measuring complexity of algorithms, time and storage. NP-complete problems.

- [x] [CSE 105 Theory of Computability](https://catalog.ucsd.edu/courses/CSE.html#cse105)
  > An introduction to the mathematical theory of computability. Formal languages. Finite automata and regular expression. Push-down automata and context-free languages. Computable or recursive functions: Turing machines, the halting problem. Undecidability.

- [ ] [CSE 110. Software Engineering](https://catalog.ucsd.edu/courses/CSE.html#cse110)
  > Introduction to software development and engineering methods, including specification, design, implementation, testing, and process. An emphasis on team development, agile methods, and use of tools such as IDEâ€™s, version control, and test harnesses.

- [ ] [CSE 120. Principles of Computer Operating Systems](https://catalog.ucsd.edu/courses/CSE.html#cse120)
  > Basic functions of operating systems; basic kernel structure, concurrency, memory management, virtual memory, file systems, process scheduling, security and protection.

### 3. Programming Languages
- Python
  ```
  course = 'CSE 110';
  print('Hello ' + course)
  ```
- Java
  ```
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    String course = "CSE 110";
    System.out.print("Hello " + course);
  }
  ```
- JavaScript
  ```
  var course = 'CSE 110';
  console.log('Hello ' + course)
  ```
- TypeScript
  ```
  const course: string = 'CSE 110';
  console.log('Hello ' + course);
  ```

### 4. Important
I need you to look at this [picture](raccoon.jpg) of a raccoon.
